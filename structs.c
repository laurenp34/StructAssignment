// Create a struct that has at least 2 data members, one must be a string.
//     You can provide struct prototypes outside of functions.
//     Don't just combine random things, make it meaningful (like food and price, athlete and associated statistic, Pokemon and something about Pokemon ..)
// Write a function that returns an example of your struct when run.
//     This should not return the same values every time.
// Write a function that prints out variables of your structs type in a reasonable way.
// Write a function that modifies values of your struct's type.
// Write a main function that tests all these things.
//     Have meaningful output.
// DONT FORGET A MAKEFILE
